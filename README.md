## About our Project
---

History Maps is a backend Ruby on Rails project that calls multiple API's in order to provide a JSON package for our History Maps FE to consume.  

The purpose of this project is to build an efficient API to streamline our Frontends consumption of information.  

We have many great thoughts for our project, but if you would like to contribute, feel free to reach out to any of the contributors on GitHub! Find our contact information below!!

## How to access our History Maps API

If you have experience with consuming APIs, please see then endpoints below and feel free to experiment with everything we provide!  

If you are new to APIs, the endpoints provided below will return JSON information for you to use on your website. By getting familiar with how API information is packaged, you will find multitudes of information to consume! ENJOY!!!!
